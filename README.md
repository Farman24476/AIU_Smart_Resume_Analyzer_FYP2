# AIU Smart Resume Analyzer 🎯

The AIU Smart Resume Analyzer project intends to transform the traditional
resume screening process by employing modern Artificial Intelligence (AI)
technology. The primary project objectives are to create and implement a system that
could analyze resumes properly, efficiently, and fairly, thereby solving the difficulties
of bias, inconsistency, and time-consuming manual review in recruitment. The project
challenge focus on the absence of intelligent automation in resume screening,
particularly in academic and entry-level career settings. The process included creating
a web-based application with Natural Language Processing (NLP), secured
authentication, and a resume parsing engine to compare candidate profiles to job
descriptions. A user-friendly dashboard was created for administrators and users to
facilitate data visualization and engagement. Key findings demonstrated the system's
ability to improve decision-making, eliminate human biasness, and improve the entire
recruitment process. The project concludes that incorporating such a system into
educational institutions and organizations can considerably improve inclusiveness,
sustainable, and successful hiring methods.
